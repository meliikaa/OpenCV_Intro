# OpenCV_Intro
OpenCV and ndarray Introductory Project
This GitHub repository contains an introductory project that explores the fundamentals of OpenCV, ndarray, and how matrices work. The project also utilizes the Mouth and Eye libraries to detect faces, and demonstrates some work with Jupyter Notebook widgets using ipywebrtc.


This project is designed to provide a hands-on introduction to OpenCV and ndarray, two essential libraries in the Python computer vision ecosystem. OpenCV is a powerful open-source computer vision library, while ndarray provides multi-dimensional arrays and efficient numerical operations on them.

The project also introduces the concept of working with matrices and demonstrates how they are utilized in image processing and computer vision tasks. By understanding matrix operations and their role in computer vision, you will be better equipped to build more sophisticated image processing applications.

Moreover, the project leverages the Mouth and Eye libraries for face detection, showcasing practical applications of computer vision techniques. Additionally, it demonstrates some interactions with Jupyter Notebook widgets using ipywebrtc, adding an interactive aspect to the project.
